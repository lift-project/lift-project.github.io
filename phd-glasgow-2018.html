	    We invite applications for a <strong>PhD</strong> position in the <span class="lift-light">Lift</span> team.	  
	    This position is <strong>fully funded (for EU nationals)</strong> by a scholarship from the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow.
	    The starting date is flexible but should be before the 1st January 2019.
      Deadline for the application is the <strong>31st of July 2018</strong>.

	  <p>
	    Applications based on artificial intelligence continue to profoundly change the ways computer systems and humans interact with each other.
      To further improve computers' understanding and enhance the intelligence of machines, we build increasingly complex algorithms and models which require more and more powerful computer hardware.
	    To accommodate the increasing demand for higher performance and efficiency of new applications, the hardware landscape is specializing and diversifying
faster than ever. This offers exciting opportunities as novel hardware architectures offer greater efficiency enabling applications which were unthinkable just a few years ago. Unfortunately, with current programming
languages and tools each new hardware target requires costly re-writing and re-optimization of the software. Instead, we would like to write portable
software which achieves high performance on each target hardware.

	  <p style="margin-top: 2em;">
	    <span class="lift-light">Lift</span> (<a href="http://www.lift-project.org">www.lift-project.org</a>) is a promising novel approach aiming to achieve this performance portability on modern parallel architectures via a sophisticated optimizing compiler which explores optimization opportunities
expressed as formal rewrite rules. This PhD project will give you the opportunity to contribute to the <span class="lift-light">Lift</span> project and help shaping the future of parallel programming and the optimization of machine learning applications.
	  </p>


	  <p style="margin-top: 1em;">
	    We are interested in build upon and strengthen the core technologies developed in the <span class="lift-light">Lift</span> project. Depending on your strength, interests, and motivation there are different possible directions for ranging from 1) foundational work in programming language theory which underpins the <span class="lift-light">Lift</span> language and compiler to 2) applied work optimizing real-world computer vision and machine learning applications and 3) enabling <span class="lift-light">Lift</span> to target specific hardware architectures such as FPGAs.
	  </p>
    
    <p style="margin-top: 1em;">
      You will join the vibrant <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/index#team"><span class="lift-light">Lift</span> research team</a> which by September 2018 will consists of 8 PhD students, one post doctoral researcher, and two leading academics - all born in 8 different countries. PhD students from the <span class="lift-light">Lift</span> team
have been engaging with our industrial partners via internships at Oracle Labs, Codeplay, Microsoft Research, Nvidia, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
