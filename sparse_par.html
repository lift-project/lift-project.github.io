                    <p>While contemporary GPU architectures are heavily biased towards
                        the execution of predictably regular data parallelism, many real
                        application domains are based around data structures which are
                        naturally sparse and irregular. We demonstrate that
                        high level programming and high performance GPU execution for
                        sparse, irregular problems are not mutually exclusive. Our insight
                        is that this can be achieved by capturing sparsity and irregularity
                        friendly implementations within the target space of a pattern-oriented,
                        high-level compilation and transformation system. By
                        working in a language rather than a library, we benefit from the
                        ability to generate implementations by program-specific composition
                        of building blocks which capture detailed, low-level implementation
                        choices. Using sparse matrix-vector multiplication as a
                        case study, we show that the resulting system produces implementations
                        for which the performance is competitive with, and sometimes
                        outperforms that obtained with leading ad-hoc approaches.
                        We show that there are correlations between good implementation
                        choices and simple measurable properties of the irregularity present
                        in problem instances. These can be used to design heuristics which
                        navigate the implementation space effectively.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In a case study, we implement a number of versions of sparse
                        matrix-vector multiplication, and achieve promising preliminary
                        performance results. On very regular sparse matrices we are able
                        to achieve up to 1.8x the performance of the state-of-the-art sparse
                        matrix-vector implementation from the clSPARSE library, and up to
                        0.7x the performance on very irregular applications.</p>
